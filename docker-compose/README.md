# Deployment modes

You can deploy in one of three modes

- Monolithic mode
- Read-Write mode
- Microservices mode

## Monolithic mode (单体模式)

The monolithic mode runs all required components in a single process.

## Read-Write mode (读写模式)

The read-write mode provides an alternative to monolithic and microservices modes.

## Microservices mode (微服务模式)

In microservices mode, components are deployed in distinct processes.
